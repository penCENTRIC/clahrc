There are no unit tests for the Validates Constancy plugin. Instead, there are
suites of integration tests in the form of Active Record models that use the
plugin while running against different versions of Active Record.

See the doc/README_FOR_APP files that are included in the various Rails
applications. Those applications can be found at in the ‘test’ branch of this
repository.
